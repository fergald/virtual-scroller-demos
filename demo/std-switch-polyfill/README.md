# `<std-switch>` polyfill

This is a work-in-progress polyfill for the proposed [`<std-switch>` element](https://github.com/tkent-google/std-switch).

Eventually it will move to its own repository and be included in this one via npm. For now it is directly included in the `<virtual-scroller>` demos source tree so we can use it there.
